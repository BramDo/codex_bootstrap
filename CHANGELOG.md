# FastAPI OpenAI Voice Demo

This project provides a lightweight FastAPI server showcasing integration with the OpenAI real-time voice model. It contains only minimal structure and placeholder code.

## Structure

```
voice_demo/
    main.py           # FastAPI application entrypoint
    routers/
        voice.py      # Placeholder for voice-related endpoints

requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the app with `uvicorn voice_demo.main:app`.
3. Implement the voice endpoint in `voice_demo/routers/voice.py` when ready.
